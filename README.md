## This is where to start with fighting games!

This is a work-in-progress guide that seeks to give new fighting game players or others interested in the genre some direction on how they can start playing and enjoying fighting games with others. By *fighting games*, I am mostly referring to the genre of 2D arcade-style fighting games that started with *Street Fighter II*. Some of the information in this guide is also applicable to 3D fighting games such as *Tekken* and *Virtua Fighter*. Platform fighters such as *Super Smash Bros.* and *Rivals of Aether* are too different from this genre for many of these ideas to be applicable, so they are not included within the scope of this guide.

# Setting up retro online games for first-timers:

- [Flycast (Naomi on FightCade) setup guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fightcade/comments/pkavwm/flycast_dojo_fightcade_setup_guide/)

You should be able to play most fighting games made before or around the year 2000 for free, online, with rollback netcode by following the above guides. Emulation can be a controversial topic among some people, but you'll never own an arcade board for most of these games even if you really wanted to, and you're doing yourself a disservice by cutting off your access to the community. Input lag/delay is almost a non-issue now thanks to advancements in emulation, run-ahead, and rollback. 

# How to play fighting games, with each kind of controller:
People won't admit this, but pad, stick, and keyboard are all equally viable input options for fighting games. They're just all different skillsets. However, you might have trouble playing on a console setup with keyboard, or have compatibility issues with certain sticks. Hitboxes, mixboxes, and other kinds of custom controllers are also good, but are recommended for those more experienced due to their price and learning curve.

	- [Pad (DS4 shown as example)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeRfBEBJxRc)
	- [Stick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi0QMmYnaKM)

Practice special moves on your controller of choice until you can hit 15 of each input in a row consistently. Try to get to a point of muscle memory where performing a special move is second nature. Mastering these initial techniques will open up almost the whole genre for you to essentially pick up and play. Learning these motions will be like learning to ride a bike, you'll never forget it, and ***it's imperative for you to be able to execute them easily.***

It's also worth noting that fighting games can have a variety of different button schemes, so feel free to look up or experiment with different layouts for your particular controller. This is a bit more work for emulated games on FightCade than it is for current commercial games.

# Some good fighting games for beginners to try:

- FightCade (free), wikis linked on titles:
	- [Street Fighter III: Third Strike](https://wiki.supercombo.gg/w/Street_Fighter_3:_3rd_Strike) is great for learning the fundamentals of fighting games and has many interesting characters to choose from. Learning combos is not necessary for playing as a beginner.
	- [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future](https://jojoban.fandom.com/wiki/JoJoban) is simple to pick up and play and has a large beginner community. Lacks double quarter-circle motions (good for beginners), and has tons of characters from Stardust Crusaders for fans of the anime/manga. Good introduction to characters with unorthodox playstyles and puppet characters as well. Has very good beginner resources on their wiki.
	- [Akatsuki Blitzkampf](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Akatsuki_Blitzkampf) is a down-to-earth doujin game that introduces some anime/poverty game concepts into a more traditional context. Smaller community than other games, but a good game to play to acclimate to anime mechanics.
	- [Super Street Fighter II: Turbo / X Grand Master Challenge](https://wiki.supercombo.gg/w/Super_Street_Fighter_2_Turbo) is the last "canonical" version of Street Fighter II and is a great game to learn to understand the origin of a lot of modern fighting game conventions. This is effectively the best version of the game that started the genre. Inputs can feel a little strict/stiff for new players, and it's got some old game jank.
	- [King of Fighters 2002](https://wiki.supercombo.gg/w/The_King_of_Fighters_2002) is a good first SNK game to try, doesn't require precise execution and has a varied cast of SNK characters from many games. Team composition is not a huge concern in this game compared to other team based games, so you can just play whoever looks cool or fun to you.
	- [Samurai Shodown V Special](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Samurai_Shodown_V_Special) is also a good first SNK game to try. It's a very slow-paced footsie based game that teaches strong fundamentals. Defense is highlighted especially in this game, and heavies/specials/supers can do massive damage, even when not included in combos. However, matches are quick due to a fast timer.

- Other free games:
	- [Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code Community Edition](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Melty_Blood/MBAACC) ([website link](https://play.meltyblood.club/)) is the definitive way to play the OG Melty Blood online. Currently overshadowed by recent sequel Melty Blood Type Lumina, this game is the poster child for how crazy and frenetic poverty anime games can be. Even though it's a fast-paced anime game, Melty is still very accessible for newcomers and easy to setup to play with friends.

- Steam/console (not free, store pages linked):
	- Street Fighter V ([PC](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/13444/Street_Fighter_V__Champion_Edition/), [PS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA01200_00-SFVCE00000000000), Arcade) is a popular game with a gigantic community. More advanced techniques from other Street Fighter games have been taken out, and combos have been made easier to execute. Has a huge roster and fan-favorites from the whole series. However, this game is somewhat controversial in the FGC.
	- Guilty Gear Strive ([PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384160/GUILTY_GEAR_STRIVE/), [PS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0036-PPSA02181_00-GGSTPS5US0000100), [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0036-PPSA02181_00-GGSTPS5US0000100), Arcade) is a simplified take on the Guilty Gear franchise that still retains much of the series's depth and complexity. It's only a year into it's lifecycle, so DLC and patches are still being actively released, and it has a huge fan following. This is a great first anime game for beginners, you're guaranteed matches online all the time.
	- Persona 4 Ultimax (PS3 (disc only), PS4/Switch/PC: To be released) is an anime fighter made for Persona fans, so a lot of care was taken to make the game accessible for beginners. Has a deep combo system for those who want to get into it, but also has auto-combos that let beginners enjoy the game without putting the time in training mode to learn complicated combos. This is an old game, but a modern port is coming out soon, and rollback is apparently going to be patched in post-release.
	- Tekken 7 ([PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/389730/TEKKEN_7/), [PS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-CUSA05972_00-000000000TEKKEN7), [Xbox One](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-7/brjgprmbv1nt), Arcade) is a 3D fighter with a very large community full of beginners and oldheads alike. 3D fighters are more intuitive and fun for some people than traditional 2D fighting games, but many fundamental skills like spacing and footsies apply to both.
	- Dragon Ball FighterZ ([PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/678950/DRAGON_BALL_FighterZ/), [PS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-CUSA09072_00-DBPROJECTZGOKU18), [Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dragon-ball-fighterz-switch/), [Xbox One](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/dragon-ball-fighterz)) is a very popular team-based anime fighter. If you're a Dragon Ball Z fan, you'll at least get a fan-service enjoyment of this game. Different characters can share many traits, and the game has many other features to simplify the learning process for beginners to team-based games.
	- DNF Duel (PC, PS4, PS5: to be released) is an upcoming 2D fighter with a very strong emphasis on accessibility for beginners, featuring autocombos and one-button-specials. 

If you aren't liking the game you're playing, feel free to just try another one, which is especially easy if you use FightCade. [Fighting Games Are For Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPBksemWym0), but not every fighting game is for every player. Once you decide what game(s) you're interested in, use the link at the end of this guide to join the community Discord server for that game to connect with other players of your game and do research. These Discord servers are a treasure trove of useful information for players who want to get better, and can help you to get matches going in games that aren't especially populated online.

Beyond this, you'll need to use your game's specific community resources to learn more about the specific character you play and the system mechanics of your game to improve. This is where things diverge too much to give decent advice, but if you take advantage of these resources, you should be well on your way to practicing your game and knowing how to improve.

If you're an experienced fighting game player who thinks that certain information should be added, or have constructive criticism for how I could improve this guide, feel free to submit an issue to this repository on GitHub or contact me at ```Mχ. Bells#1917``` on Discord.

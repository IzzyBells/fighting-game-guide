## Where to start with fighting games!

# Setup for first-timers:
- [FightCade 2 primer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mBBLVMCzzlq7eejTvGaoCFb9H2VM_PuAsbM8pjBmoY)
- [Flycast (Naomi on FightCade) setup guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fightcade/comments/pkavwm/flycast_dojo_fightcade_setup_guide/)

You should be able to play most fighting games made before or around the year 2000 for free, online, with rollback netcode by following the above guides. Using emulation might be a topic of 

# How to play fighting games, with each kind of controller:
People won't admit this, but pad, stick, and keyboard are all equally viable input options for fighting games. They're just all different skillsets. However, you might have trouble playing on a console setup with keyboard, or have compatibility issues with certain sticks. Hitboxes, mixboxes, and other kinds of custom controllers are also good, but are recommended for those more experienced due to their price and learning curve.

	- [Pad (DS4 shown as example)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeRfBEBJxRc)
	- [Stick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi0QMmYnaKM)

Practice special moves on your controller of choice until you can hit 15 of each input in a row consistently. Try to get to a point of muscle memory where performing a special move is second nature.

# Some good fighting games for beginners to try:
- FightCade (free), wikis linked on titles:
	- [Street Fighter III: Third Strike](https://wiki.supercombo.gg/w/Street_Fighter_3:_3rd_Strike) is great for learning the fundamentals of fighting games and has many interesting characters to choose from. Learning combos is not necessary for playing as a beginner.
	- [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future](https://jojoban.fandom.com/wiki/JoJoban) is simple to pick up and play and has a large beginner community. Lacks double quarter-circle motions (good for beginners), and has tons of characters from Stardust Crusaders for fans of the anime/manga. Good introduction to characters with unorthodox playstyles and puppet characters as well. Has very good beginner resources on their wiki.
	- [Akatsuki Blitzkampf](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Akatsuki_Blitzkampf) is a down-to-earth doujin game that introduces some anime/poverty game concepts into a more traditional context. Smaller community than other games, but a good game to play to acclimate to anime mechanics.
	- [Super Street Fighter II: Turbo / X Grand Master Challenge](https://wiki.supercombo.gg/w/Super_Street_Fighter_2_Turbo) is the last "canonical" version of Street Fighter II and is a great game to learn to understand the origin of a lot of modern fighting game conventions. This is effectively the best version of the game that started the genre. Inputs can feel a little strict/stiff for new players, and it's got some old game jank.
	- [King of Fighters 2002](https://wiki.supercombo.gg/w/The_King_of_Fighters_2002) is a good first SNK game to try, doesn't require precise execution and has a varied cast of SNK characters from many games. Team composition is not a huge concern in this game compared to other team based games, so you can just play whoever looks cool or fun to you.
	- [Samurai Shodown V Special](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Samurai_Shodown_V_Special) is also a good first SNK game to try. It's a very slow-paced footsie based game that teaches strong fundamentals. Defense is highlighted especially in this game, and heavies/specials/supers can do massive damage, even when not included in combos. However, matches are quick due to a fast timer.
- Steam/console (not free, store pages linked):
	- Street Fighter V ([PC](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/13444/Street_Fighter_V__Champion_Edition/), [PS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA01200_00-SFVCE00000000000)) is a popular game with a gigantic community. More advanced techniques from other Street Fighter games have been taken out, and combos have been made easier to execute. Has a huge roster and fan-favorites from the whole series. However, this game is somewhat controversial in the FGC.
	- Guilty Gear Strive ([PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384160/GUILTY_GEAR_STRIVE/), [PS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0036-PPSA02181_00-GGSTPS5US0000100), [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0036-PPSA02181_00-GGSTPS5US0000100)) is a simplified take on the Guilty Gear franchise that still retains much of the series's depth and complexity. It's only a year into it's lifecycle, so DLC and patches are still being actively released, and it has a huge fan following. This is a great first anime game for beginners, you're guaranteed matches online all the time.
	- Persona 4 Ultimax ([PS3](), [PS4](), [Switch](), [PC]() is an anime fighter made for Persona fans, so a lot of care was taken to make the game accessible for beginners. Has a deep combo system for those who want to get into it, but also has auto-combos that let beginners enjoy the game without putting the time in training mode to learn complicated combos. This is an old game, but a modern port is coming out soon, and rollback is apparently going to be patched in post-release.
	- Tekken 7 is a 3D fighter with a very large community full of beginners and oldheads alike. 3D fighters are more intuitive and fun for some people than traditional 2D fighting games, but many fundamental skills like spacing and footsies apply to both.
	- Dragon Ball FighterZ is a very popular team-based anime fighter. If you're a Dragon Ball Z fan, you'll at least get a fan-service enjoyment of this game. Different characters can share many traits, and the game has many other features to simplify the learning process for beginners to team-based games.
	- DNF Duel is an upcoming 2D fighter with a very strong emphasis on accessibility for beginners, featuring autocombos and one-button-specials.
